For a while now, I've been looking for a way to automate how we do wsus patching. For some reason, all examples and googling yield either references to dot net or framework methods and attributes, or spice works answers that give a hint of what I'm looking for. But not really.

Tried cleaning, then rebuilding. Forced VS to load the symbols. We are thrilled to announce the release of the NET Framework 4.8 today.
